<h1>DBMS </h1>
<p id="para1">A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. It provides a systematic and organized way of storing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. DBMS allows for data independence, reduces redundancy, and ensures data integrity through rules and constraints. Examples of popular DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.<p>
<p id="para2">DBMSs support various operations such as querying data using SQL, updating records, and managing transactions. They also offer features like concurrency control, backup and recovery, and user access management. By separating data management from application logic, DBMSs simplify software development and improve scalability and security in both small-scale and enterprise environments.
